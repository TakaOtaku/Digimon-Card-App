    Version 1.5 | 04.11.2022



  Hey everyone!

  Just a small and quick update. Some may have noticed the site being broken a few times the last few days. This was because the host to which I switched was quite unreliable, so I just switched to yet another host. With this one I have more freedom and the site should be faster than ever and I shouldn't have to worry for the next few years about server problems.

  I also received a few donations and wanted to say thank you to every donor for supporting this site! The next few updates should be great!



  Feature

  - Changed the width of some elements in the profile page

  - Changed the look of the View-Card Dialog (Open to Feedback)





  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Version 1.4 | 02.11.2022

  Feature

  - Moved every saved data to a new database. If there is an error with your save, please contact me on discord, TakaOtaku#8538. The switch was needed to keep the server cost down and keep the website ad-free.
  - The View-Card dialog does now have a smaller text-size, so that you can view more information at once.
  - BT12 Cards are updated
  - New Restricted Cards are added



    A few other things at the end:

      Adding more and more features to the site is quite time consuming, so if you are a developer or designer and want to help out, please contact me, so we can build an even better website!


    If you want to write tournament reports or other blog-posts you can also contact me!
    And if you have a good overview of the meta, and want to help me keep the tierlist acceptable also contact me!
